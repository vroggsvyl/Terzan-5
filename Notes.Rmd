Add information about what contour levels are representing

simulating background noise - poisson generated noise
modelling multiple close together << 

Look at other thesis statements - Workshop with Ben sometime in the week starting 29/4
Start thinking big picture
Conclusions?

uni-variate mm - problematic?
Bi-variate mixture modelling
packages for mixture modelling
viable functions for density
inverse cdf
cdf

have a look at packages for mixture modelling and what they require - expecially for bivariate mixture modelling

Mixture Modelling R packages
-mixtools - focuses on gaussian densities. Can't input custom
-mclust (caused fishbowl computer to pause) 
-mixAK - a lot of functions
-flexmix - finite mixtures of regression models
-gamlss and gamlss.mx
