Add information about what contour levels are representing

simulating background noise - poisson generated noise

uni-variate mm - problematic?
Bi-variate mixture modelling
packages for mixture modelling
viable functions for density
inverse cdf
cdf

have a look at packages for mixture modelling and what they require - especially for bivariate mixture modelling

Mixture Modelling R packages
-mixtools - focuses on gaussian densities. Can't input custom
-mclust (caused fishbowl computer to pause) 
-mixAK - a lot of functions
-flexmix - finite mixtures of regression models
-gamlss and gamlss.mx


rMOFFAT - qq plots
simulated data

another alternative
use optim 
parameter space becomes a bit crazy

Start writing a first draft
Draft by Saturday May 17th


Inverse of cdf
not pdf
accept reject - rejection sampling

Prepare a Rmarkdown and annotate it thoroughly and upload to github
